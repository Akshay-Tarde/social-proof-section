## My process
I used both flexbox and grid for different sections of the site. 
The sections which required unusual position were styled using grid. 
For simple styling, flexbox was used.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to create a background image effect using SVGs with the help of position: absolute.
CSS Grid's ability to manipulate space and layout also came in handy.


### Continued development

I could not give the background image effect using SVGs for the mobile layout.
For some reason in this project, the hover links didn't work.
